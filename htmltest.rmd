This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r set seed, eval= TRUE, echo = TRUE}

random_number <- runif(1, 0, 10^8)
set.seed(seed = random_number)
hist(rnorm(100,0,1))
summary(cars)

```



You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

install.packages("devtools")

```{r session info, eval = TRUE, echo=FALSE}
devtools::session_info()
```
